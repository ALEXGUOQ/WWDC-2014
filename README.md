## WWDC 2014

This was my submission for the WWDC 2014 Student Scholarship, which I ended up winning! I had to put this together in a rush while studying for exams so it isn't that great, but I'm happy it got me a spot.

**Details**:

* Content is loaded via JSON files, using [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle). That includes styled text, images, and video.
* All `UITableView`/`UICollectionView`s in the app use XIBs for the cells, using dynamically sized using Autolayout with [Mensa](https://github.com/jordanekay/Mensa)
* It's the first app I've "designed" (if you can call it that) by myself! Shout out to [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) for making that easy.
