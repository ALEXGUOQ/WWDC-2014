By removing everything that was not an integral part of experiencing music, we ended up with a product that felt far more refined. Reducing complexity allowed us to focus on the key elements that truly mattered.<br /><br />The two main focuses were the album grid and the centralized queue. The grid was the Core Animation-backed crown jewel of the app. Lots of performance optimization went into ensuring that it scrolled smoothly.<br /><br />The queue challenged us to build a centralized control for controlling playback while keeping with our philosophy of minimalism. So many little interactions and gestures were implemented to make it simple yet powerful.</span></div>",
