So I built them.<br /><br />A friend and I collaborated on <strong>Butter</strong>, a framework that implemented CALayer-backed versions of many AppKit controls. Flamingo is the first production application with a UI implemented largely on Butter.<br /><br />Butter gave me a solid foundation to work with, but Flamingo's entirely custom UI was a massive undertaking on its own. Every control was designed and implemented meticulously. Even things like preferences switches.</span></div>",
